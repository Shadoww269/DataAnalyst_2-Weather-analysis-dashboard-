Hello there,
This Project is based on weather dataset,Here are the instructions to create an Weather anlysis dashboard.
Below are the detailed instructions to guide you through the project:
Project Details:
● Domain: Data Analysis
● Project Name: Weather Analysis
● Level: Medium
Project Requirements:( Do with your knowledge if you feel difficult)
Data Preparation with Python:
● Use Python to clean and preprocess the weather dataset.
● Handle missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies in the
data.
● Utilize libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for
efficient data manipulation and visualization.
Advanced Analysis with Power BI or Tableau:
● Leverage Power BI or Tableau for advanced data analysis on the
weather dataset.
● Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to highlight trends
and patterns in the weather data.
● Utilize the visualization tools to present insights in a clear and
compelling manner.
Correlation and Regression Analysis:
● Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between
different weather parameters.
● Implement regression analysis to predict one weather parameter
based on others.
● Use statistical measures to assess the strength and significance of the
identified correlations.

TASKS:

Descriptive Statistics:
● Calculate and present descriptive statistics for key weather parameters, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
● Use visualizations to enhance the understanding of the distribution of weather data.
Geospatial Analysis:
● Integrate geospatial analysis into your project to visualize how weather patterns vary across different geographical locations.
● Utilize maps or other geographic visualizations to showcase regional weather trends.
Time Series Analysis:
● Perform time series analysis to identify seasonal trends and patterns in the weather data.
● Create visualizations that illustrate how weather parameters change over time, considering daily, monthly, or yearly patterns.
Data Exploration Tasks:
● Explore and present interesting insights about the weather data that go beyond the specified analysis tasks.
● Use your creativity to uncover unique patterns or anomalies in the dataset.
Data Storytelling:
● Develop a narrative that explains the story behind the weather data.
● Craft a presentation or report that effectively communicates your findings
to both technical and non-technical audiences.
